  <h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
  
  <p>
    I'm a curious and creative software developer who loves building things â€” whether it's a clean web interface, a clever script, or a side project that scratches a personal itch.
  </p>

  <p>
    Iâ€™m always exploring new technologies, automating workflows, and occasionally over-engineering solutions for fun. When Iâ€™m not coding, you might find me reading, walking around the city, or thinking about the next idea I want to build.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site is my little corner on the internet â€” a place to share projects, ideas, and maybe a bit of personality too.
