  <h1>Hi there 👋</h1>
  
  <p>
    I'm a software developer passionate about building meaningful tools and solving complex problems.  
    At work, I focus on developing and maintaining software products while exploring ways to make workflows smoother and more efficient.  
    I enjoy bridging technical skills with creativity, whether it’s coding, designing dashboards, or automating repetitive tasks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of work, I’m equally curious and love exploring many areas of life. I’m into finance, stocks, economics, and politics — always trying to understand how the world works.  
    I also enjoy video games 🎮, going out with friends, and just having fun when I’m not experimenting with side projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site is my little corner on the internet — a place to share projects, ideas, and maybe a bit of personality too.
